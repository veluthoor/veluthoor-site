<p>As I write from Srinagar today, I'd just like to appreciate BRO (Border Road Organisation) for making my trips of the last week possible. BRO develops and maintains road networks in India's border areas and comes under the ownership of Department of Defence, Govt of India. They've also been credited with building world's highest altitude road and are the reason that many travellers like me have been able to travel comfortably through Ladakh and Kashmir while enjoying the scenic roads that take us through these locations safely. </p><p>While I appreciate BRO for building these amazing engineering marvels of their own, I think I have an even higher degree of appreciation for the witty one liners that they've written along every few hundred metres. Here's a collection of some of them that are stuck in my head. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/5.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="750" height="550" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/5.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/5.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="750" height="550" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/3.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/3.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="750" height="550" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/2.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/2.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/4.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="750" height="550" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/4.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/4.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
