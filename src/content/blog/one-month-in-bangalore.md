<p>It's been over a month since I started my first real job and moved to Bangalore! And I've got to say it's been quite an eventful month. After years of ranting about how much I hate Bangalore on the 8th of November 2023, I packed my life in two suitcases, hopped on a bus and moved to Bangalore - my new home for the [considerable or maybe forever 😉] future. <br><br>I now work as a Product Manager (PM) at Moolya. On the work front, the last month has been a steady learning curve. Being my first time working from an office, I realized I've seriously underestimated how much more enjoyable it is, than working from home. For context, despite my company having a flexible work policy, I choose to be in office almost every day. Since, I work in a small team in the product arm of Moolya called Bugasura, I enjoy the feels of a startup, but for all the good parts I have the large 500 member team of Moolya to fall back on. It kind of feels like the best of both worlds. <br><br>A new problem that I've been struggling with is explaining what I do as a Product manager, to folks outside of tech in under 30seconds. If anybody knows what to say, please help a girl out!! A friend asked me last week, </p><blockquote><br>Do you like figure out what it should be like conceptually, and go into the engineer's den and be like "losers, gimme a software that farts rainbow. Right Now!</blockquote><p>As much as I wish that's what my job is, and how fun that sounds, I really need something better to describe my job. </p>
