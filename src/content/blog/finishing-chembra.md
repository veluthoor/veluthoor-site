<p>I know I'm awfully late to this post, but I had to write about my first real trek that I finished in the last week of October. Situated amidst the lush green tea plantations of Wayanad, the trek ends with a breath taking view of a heart shaped pond from the top. </p><p>Every day the forest department allows only 150 people to complete he trek. To ensure you are among those 150, you are required to arrive before 5am and book your slot. The trek begins around 7am and you are required to begin descent before 12 noon. If you're quick and are decently fit, you should be able to comfortably finish the trek in less than 3.5 hours. Also though this is a beginner level trek, a good level of fitness is required for completion, many folks who started with me were unable to keep up with the trek. </p><p>The trek starts off with low lying trails surrounded by tea plantations. This is the easiest part of the trek with some flat grounds. After around 1km's of this, you will begin the steeper sections of the trek, this section harder than the previous one has loads of slippery rocks and muddy slopes. It's not recommended to do the trek post rains, as it gets slippery and risky to complete. <br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>
