<p>Every time I tell people that I've been travelling, most people who would like to set out to do something similar ask me how much I ended up spending. For most folks, it's surprising that I was able to fund it on my own as well. </p><p>Before I get to the breakdown, here are something's I keep in mind before travelling and bit of information about the sort of expenses I incur generally.</p><ul><li>In case I'm flying I always book my flights well in advance, and usually plan my travel dates around the best flight prices.</li><li>I usually prefer good quality hostel accommodations from chains like Zostel if available. If not, my second choice is to look for affordable Airbnb's. If neither of these are available, I look at budget hotels. </li><li>Most of my travel happens in trains. When travelling in the day, I usually travel by Sleeper or Sitting class. For overnight journey's I usually try to travel by 3 tier AC. </li><li>For food, 50% of the time I skip breakfast and have an early lunch. Which means I usually have two major meals a day. I also usually have a lot of street food when travelling, which also keeps my food expenses quite low. </li></ul><h2 id="breakdown">Breakdown</h2><h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3><p>Flights: ₹4290 (BOM-CCJ)</p><p>Trains:</p><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close"><div class="kg-toggle-heading"><h4 class="kg-toggle-heading-text">Breakup</h4><button class="kg-toggle-card-icon"><svg id="Regular" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path class="cls-1" d="M23.25,7.311,12.53,18.03a.749.749,0,0,1-1.06,0L.75,7.311"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-toggle-content"><p>CLT-PDY: 347</p><p>MAS-VSKP: 1498</p><p>VSKP-PURI: 292</p><p>PURI-HWH: 1439</p><p>SDAH-GAYA: 1144</p><p>GAYA - PNBE: 289</p><p>PNBE-BSB: 193</p><p>BSB-HWH: 3383 (Premium Tatkal)</p><p>HWH-R: 1223</p><p>R-JBP: 919</p><p>JBP-GWL: 1143</p><p>GWL-VGLJ: 363</p><p>VGLJ-JBP: 838</p><p>JBP-RKMP: 978</p><p>RKMP-CSMT: 2032</p><p>CSMT-LNL: 273</p><p>LNL-CSMT: 273</p></div></div><p><strong>Total Train Expenses: </strong>₹<strong>16,627</strong></p><p>Bus:</p><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close"><div class="kg-toggle-heading"><h4 class="kg-toggle-heading-text">Breakup</h4><button class="kg-toggle-card-icon"><svg id="Regular" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path class="cls-1" d="M23.25,7.311,12.53,18.03a.749.749,0,0,1-1.06,0L.75,7.311"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-toggle-content"><p>Pondicherry-Chennai: ₹619</p><p>Other Bus Expenses: ~ ₹300</p></div></div><p><strong>Total Bus Expenses: </strong>₹919</p><p>Internal Travel Expenses (Cabs, Autos, Rickshaws) : ~ ₹4000</p><h3 id="total-transportation-expenses-%E2%82%B925836">Total Transportation Expenses: ₹25,836</h3><h3 id="accommodation">Accommodation:</h3><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close"><div class="kg-toggle-heading"><h4 class="kg-toggle-heading-text">Break Up</h4><button class="kg-toggle-card-icon"><svg id="Regular" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path class="cls-1" d="M23.25,7.311,12.53,18.03a.749.749,0,0,1-1.06,0L.75,7.311"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-toggle-content"><p>Zostel Plus Lonavla(2 nights): ₹2349</p><p>Gostops Varanasi(2 Nights): ₹958</p><p>Shamuka Homestay, Puri(3 nights): ₹3783</p><p>Senamura Yoga Ashram, Bodh Gaya(2 Nights): ₹2017</p><p>Betwa Homestay, Bhopal (2nights): ₹2522</p><p>The Aster Heritage, Kolkata(5 nights): ₹5566</p><p>Hotel Grace, Gwalior(2 nights): ₹3195</p><p>Backpacker Cowies:(3 nights) ₹3213</p></div></div><h3 id="total-accommodation-expenses-%E2%82%B9-23603">Total Accommodation Expenses: ₹ 23,603</h3><h3 id="food-expenses">Food Expenses</h3><p>As I don't have exact grasp over my day-to-day food expenses I am going to make an approximate that I spent on average ₹300 per day. It would be good to keep in mind that I didn't have much food expenditure when I stayed with friends, and that some of my accommodation charges already included one meal. I also ate lots of street food, so I didn't spend much on food overall, other than the occasional indulgences. </p><h3 id="total-food-expenditure-%E2%82%B9-12600">Total Food Expenditure ~ ₹ 12,600</h3><p>Overall this would mean my 42-day trip costed me ₹62,039.
