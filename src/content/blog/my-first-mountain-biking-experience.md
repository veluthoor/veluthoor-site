<p>The past few days have really been mostly been about pushing my body's limits. I had the chance to visit India's first MTB (Mountain Biking) Adventure Park in India, at Circuit Wheelz, Wayanad. This trail runs both uphill and downhill through beautiful scenic mountain views, waterfalls and tea gardens - offering an amazing mix of forest trails, rocky terrains and scenic beauty. Created as a beginner level trail, I'm not particularly sure if it was for beginners. However, one thing the Circuit Wheelz doesn't let you do is give up mid-way! Even if you think you can't physically finish the adventure, they'll push you to at least take the adventure on foot while you bring your cycle along haha. </p><p>I couldn't feel the pain in my butt for the next two days after I completed the adventure. While uphill pushes you to use all your strength, downhill is truly like a never ending roller-coaster ride, and if you're like me that may also include quite some falls as well :( </p><p> Here's a clip from the ride :)</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cy-SzZpPJDg8FT-Z-9zXT_eOEwA6O63qsGGlUU0/">https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cy-SzZpPJDg8FT-Z-9zXT_eOEwA6O63qsGGlUU0/</a></p>
