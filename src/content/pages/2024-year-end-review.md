In 2025, I hope I gain more inner peace honestly to become the calm amidst the chaos. </li><li><u>What was your biggest achievement of the year?</u><br>I know this is becoming a running review, but training for a marathon without getting injured is my biggest achievement. </li><li><u>What was your biggest failure?</u><br>I did live a part of the year, comparing my life to a lot of other people with different journey's. I'm still working on it, but it's still a fail of the year I'd say.</li><li><u>Did you suffer illness or injury?</u><br>No</li><li><u>What was the best thing you bought?</u><br>Coros Pace 3 :)</li><li><u>Where did most of your money go?</u><br>Running and travelling for races :)</li><li><u>What did you get really, really, really excited about?</u><br>Running</li><li><u>Compared to this time last year,you: are:</u><br>much more confident in my body, and at my highest ever fitness level. </li><li><u>What do you wish you’d done more of?</u><br>Reading, Cooking, Time with Parents</li><li><u>What do you wish you’d done less of?</u><br>Commute</li><li><u>Did you fall in love in 2024?</u><br>No.</li><li><u>What did you want and get?</u><br>I've always wanted to work on a product/in a space, I personally absolutely love.

I spent my birthday with a 2 of my friends dancing to Bollywood songs till midnight!
