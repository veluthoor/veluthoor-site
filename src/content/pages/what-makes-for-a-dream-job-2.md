<p>I've been in this personal journey for a while now. I've had multiple learning over the past 2 years of working, and much more over the past few months of being on a break to think about what my dream career looks like. I've jotted down my thoughts + notes from resources I went through to answer this question for myself. I thought it might be useful for other folks as well. </p><h2 id="about-my-journey">About my Journey</h2><p>I've been working full-time for a couple of years now. I've switched between 3-4 companies at the time of writing this. It may seem surprising considering I'm only 22 - but the decisions were contingent on my life at the time and what I wanted from work. I've learnt quite a bit about myself and what I want from work and the people I work with through my experiences, and I'm continuing on that journey :) </p><p><strong>Personal Learning</strong></p><ul><li>I enjoy working in teams</li><li>I derive a lot of satisfaction from knowing the work I do is making a difference - and that I'm part of a larger mission. </li><li>I enjoy seeing the real results of my work being implemented. </li></ul><p>Note: I understand many things may not be implemented eventually. But, one thing I like about working in product, is seeing my ideas come to life. This is much rarer in say a field like marketing, where my ideas simply result in numbers, rather than real changes. Technically, it may be a "real result" to somebody else, just that it didn't feel that way to me, unfortunately.  </p><p>Major Resources Utilised: </p><ul><li>Paul Millerd's<em> The Pathless Path </em></li><li><a href="https://80000hours.org/">https://80000hours.org/</a></li><li>Lots and lots of self-reflection</li></ul><p>Finally, I haven't and I don't think I'll ever find what brings me the most satisfaction forever in a career - because I'm sure I'll keep evolving as a person. But I'd like to find some answers over my lifetime. Hence, this page will always be a work in progress for me to document these things for myself. </p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><p>To find a dream job, look for:</p><ol><li>Work you’re good at.</li><li>Work that helps others.</li><li>Supportive conditions: engaging work that lets you enter a state of flow, supportive colleagues, lack of major negatives like unfair pay, and work that fits your personal life.</li></ol><p><strong>Money May not be that Important Beyond a certain point. </strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/80K_incomewellnessB_V6-1024x543.png" class="kg-image" alt="Money and happiness survey" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="543"></figure><p><em>High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being</em>, D. Kahneman and A. Deaton, 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full" rel="noopener">link</a></p><ul><li>Ideally, I think personally if I can get most things I need without worrying if I have enough in my bank account - I'd be pretty happy. </li></ul><p>Having a very undemanding job is bad — that’s boring. Having demands that exceed your abilities is bad too: they cause harmful stress. <strong>The sweet spot is where the demands placed on you match your abilities</strong> — that’s a fulfilling challenge.</p><p>Helping others isn’t the only route to a meaningful career, but it’s widely accepted by researchers that it’s one of the most powerful.</p><p>Since good relationships are such an important part of having a fulfilling life, it’s important to be able to become friends with at least a couple of people at work. And this probably means working with at least a few people who are similar to you.</p><ul><li>Realised this is quite important for me. One of the places I worked at, I had barely ever had a non-work related conversation with anybody at work. Not that they were bad folks or anything, I just never related to any of them. </li></ul><p>To be satisfied, everything above is important. But you also need the <em>absence</em> of things that make work unpleasant. All of the following tend to be linked to job <em>dis</em>satisfaction.</p><p><strong>A long commute, especially if it’s over an hour by bus, Very long hours, Pay you feel is unfair, Job insecurity.</strong></p><ul><li>Didn't think too much before hand, but this is definitely going to be a big thing I look out for, in my next job!</li></ul>
