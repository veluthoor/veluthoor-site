And I got a surprise birthday party organized by Sid and almost all of my bluru friends came, it was quite a fun night and truly grateful for all the people who made time to show up for me like that.</li><li><u>What kept you sane?</u><br>Travel, Rehab and Physiotherapists.</li><li><u>Who did you miss?</u><br>Friends who moved away :)</li><li><u>Who was the best new person you met?</u><br>Abhee :)</li><li><u>Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2025.</u><br>One bad day doesn't mean your life is in shambles :)</li></ol>
